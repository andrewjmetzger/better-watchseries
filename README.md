## Companion Extensions and UserScripts

It is recommended to use Better WatchSeries along with these extensions and userscripts for the best experience:
  - Ads Bypasser (https://adsbypasser.github.io/): Userscript. Skips timers, ad pages, and other annoyances on many more sites than Better WatchSeries supports
  - uBlock Origin (https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock): Extension. A free, fast, ad-blocker. Highly customizable via filter lists and other settings. Better than AdBlock Plus.
